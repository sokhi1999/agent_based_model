# Introduction: 

Agent Based Modelling is a powerful simulation modelling technique that has seen a number of applications in the last few years. We develop and simulate an artifical society based off of a Sugarscape model developed in the 1990â€™s to explain the tendency towards the unequal distribution of wealth in society. This was done by manipulating initial conditions on the original Sugarscape model to analyze and predict future changes. The subsequent part of the article deals with methodology and objectives of this paper. At the end, a brief look into future challenges is given.
